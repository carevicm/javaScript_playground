Introduction

Welcome to my JavaScript_playground! This is where I tinker, play, and experiment with different JavaScript concepts, challenges, and fun little programs.

From Fibonacci sequences to FizzBuzz challenges to quirky calculators, this repository is a testament to my journey of exploring the fascinating world of JavaScript.
